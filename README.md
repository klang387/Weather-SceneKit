# Weather-SceneKit

Simple test app to retrieve weather data from a REST API, and display it using low-poly models with SceneKit.

Primary interest is experimenting with SceneKit, and CoreData NSManagedObject subclasses that also adhere to Codable, making for easy parsing and persistence of the API data.
